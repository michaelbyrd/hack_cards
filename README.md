# Cards

This is the first gem I have created.  Its goal is to create a platform for
designing 'cards' that can contain different media objects and know how to
display themselves.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hack_cards'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hack_cards
